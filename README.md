Sentiment Analysis - Java Projet
========================

This project was a project during my final year degree internship for 3 months in UniKL, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
I was being supervised by Pn Siti Salwa and Dr Fara Wahida.

--------------
**Project Description**

The project consists of analyzing tweets (either mentions or user's tweets) to observe the user's sentiments while tweeting a tweet or mentioning other users by means of a Java programme.

--------------
**Future Evolution**

It's really a simple programme as for now (the project ended July 2018). I will be looking forward to improvise the programme as a whole such as more interface implementation and more functionality implementation.
